## To-do List

About my *to-do list*:
- My application will allow users to add tasks to remind them to complete it
- Anyone could use a to-do list for reminders such as groceries, chores, but I am hoping **students** like me can use it to stay on top of their work
- As a busy student myself, I use to-do lists daily to stay on track of my assignments so it would be cool if I could use a to-do list I made myself

#User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to add and remove tasks
- As a user, I want to be able to view completed tasks
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task complete
- As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks that I don't need anymore
