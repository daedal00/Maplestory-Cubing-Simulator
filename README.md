## Maplestory cubing simulator

About my *cubing simulator*:
- My application will allow users to add equipment and re-roll stats with cubes until a desired outcome
- As a maplestory player myself, I know the satisfaction that comes with cubing and finally achieving the desired legendary stats, but the cost that comes with it is too high. 
- Players can use this simulator to roll cubes without having to spend thousands of dollars.
